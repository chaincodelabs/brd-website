  topic: Strategic Latency Reduction in Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks
  abstract: Most permissionless blockchain networks run on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which offer flexibility and decentralization at the expense of performance (e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck for most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based applications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to latency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can accrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the study of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first define two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications. We then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local peering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60% of the global latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or, in targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are not due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network model, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P network’s latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences sufficient peer churn and transaction activity

  topic: Privacy and Scaling with zk-SNARKs and Client-Side Validation
  abstract: The client-side validation approach removes transaction verification from the consensus rules. Instead, transaction data posted to the blockchain is only interpreted on each individual node ("client-side"). This approach allows building protocols with very low on-chain size and verification cost, while providing strong privacy.
            <br>
            This session covers Shielded CSV, a novel client-side validation protocol that, in contrast to existing client-side validation protocols, only requires 64 bytes of on-chain space regardless of the size of the transaction and is fully private. The protocol's communication cost between transaction sender and receiver is independent of the transaction history. Furthermore, Shielded CSV can be instantiated with existing cryptographic zk-SNARK primitives.
            <br>
            With a trust-minimized mechanism like BitVM2 to bridge between the blockchain and the client-side validation protocol, Shielded CSV adds strong privacy to Bitcoin and scales Bitcoin to 100 transactions per second. It has been described as "the most useful thing you can do with BitVM2".
            <br>
            Even without a bridge, Shielded CSV can be used to create a private cryptocurrency pegged to bitcoin (for example via the one-way peg) that offers substantial advantage over existing private cryptocurrencies. These currencies require users to validate all transactions, which contain relatively large and  computationally expensive Zero-Knowledge proofs. ShieldedCSV, however, only requires the recipient of a transaction to download the full transaction data, which results in significant reductions in computational and bandwidth costs. Furthermore, ShieldedCSV derives its resistance to double-spending from Bitcoin, eliminating the need for its own consensus mechanism.

  topic: "From Monitoring Bitcoin to Verifying Lightning: Modeling Aspects of the Bitcoin Universe"
  abstract: We are monitoring the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network since 2015 and will report on some interesting observations and findings. Over the last years, this longitudinal monitoring study shows that the Bitcoin network is remarkably stable. However, we could also observe singular events that gave unique insights into the network's structure. We discuss what we know and what we do not know about the actual Bitcoin network and the corresponding quality of Bitcoin network models. Furthermore, we examine how to prove Lightning secure by formally modeling payment channels, assess the compatibility of corresponding first and second layer models, and close with some future research directions

  topic: De-Anonymization in Bitcoin
  abstract: There are many heuristics that are used in practice to de-anonymize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it is often hard to assess their effectiveness given a lack of ground-truth data.  This talk presents an overview of these heuristics, as well as new research to both improve them and increase our confidence in their results
