  topic: Strategic Latency Reduction in Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks
  abstract: Most permissionless blockchain networks run on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which offer flexibility and decentralization at the expense of performance (e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck for most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based applications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to latency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can accrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the study of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first define two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications. We then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local peering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60% of the global latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or, in targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are not due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network model, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P network’s latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences sufficient peer churn and transaction activity

  topic: "No More Guesswork: Ready-to-Use Distributed Key Generation for FROST"
  abstract: Threshold signature schemes such as FROST are gaining considerable attention in Bitcoin. Yet, Distributed Key Generation (DKG), with its heavy requirements on the underlying communication mechanisms such as secure channels and a secure broadcast mechanism, remains the Achilles heel of threshold signatures and holds back their deployment in the real world.
            <br>
            In this talk, we will first take a detailed look at the obstacles that implementers and practitioners face in practice. We will foster an understanding of potential pitfalls and attacks, in particular those that can arise from the (mis)use of reliable broadcast protocols. We will then provide recommendations and guidelines on how to avoid these pitfalls and implement broadcast securely in practice. A key technical ingredient in our recommendations is a simple extension of the Goldwasser-Bellare echo broadcast protocol, which we have not seen proposed in the context of DKG so far.
            <br>
            With these learnings in mind, we present ChillDKG, a DKG protocol that fully incorporates minimal but sufficient implementations of secure channels and reliable broadcast, and thereby hides this complexity from engineers entirely. The protocol addresses further practical problems by eliminating the need for fresh randomness per threshold setup and offering a practical solution for backups. To facilitate real-world adoption of ChillDKG, we have been working on a publicly available specification that aims to be comprehensive and easy to use

  topic: "From Monitoring Bitcoin to Verifying Lightning: Modeling Aspects of the Bitcoin Universe"
  abstract: We are monitoring the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network since 2015 and will report on some interesting observations and findings. Over the last years, this longitudinal monitoring study shows that the Bitcoin network is remarkably stable. However, we could also observe singular events that gave unique insights into the network's structure. We discuss what we know and what we do not know about the actual Bitcoin network and the corresponding quality of Bitcoin network models. Furthermore, we examine how to prove Lightning secure by formally modeling payment channels, assess the compatibility of corresponding first and second layer models, and close with some future research directions

  topic: De-Anonymization in Bitcoin
  abstract: There are many heuristics that are used in practice to de-anonymize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it is often hard to assess their effectiveness given a lack of ground-truth data.  This talk presents an overview of these heuristics, as well as new research to both improve them and increase our confidence in their results
