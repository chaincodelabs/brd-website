  topic: An Exploration of Bitcoin's P2P Network and its Security
  abstract: Why is Bitcoin's P2P network important to Bitcoin's security? How might it be attacked and what would be the impact to Bitcoin's security?  This talk will address these questions by describing these attacks, providing a primer on Bitcoin Core's P2P architecture and providing a brief history of how the design of Bitcoin Core has evolved to better address these threats

  bio: Ittay is an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty at the Technion and an Associate Director at the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3). Eyal completed his PhD at the Technion, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Cornell University. He was awarded a 2018 Alon Fellowship and a 2022 Krill Prize. His research focuses on performance and security in decentralized systems
  topic: Authentication
  abstract: Client-side security is both more challenging and more critical in decentralized systems, as there is no trusted party that can replace lost credentials or revert token theft. Despite its significance, the design of authentication mechanisms—referred to as "wallets" in this context—remains an open question. We define the authentication problem, establish bounds and optimal mechanisms, and derive concrete improvement proposals for existing wallets and systems
